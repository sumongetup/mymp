/**
 * Seed reference data from parliament.gov.bd: every parliament the source
 * knows, and the constituency set of each election it holds rows for.
 *
 * Network here, logic in seed-core.ts (shared with the PGlite integration
 * test). Re-running is safe: every write is an upsert on the source's ids.
 * Divisions and districts come from the current election's set only (its
 * spellings, Bogura and Cumilla, and the only set with divisions on every
 * seat). Every other set runs after it and looks districts up by the
 * source's district id, which is the same across sets.
